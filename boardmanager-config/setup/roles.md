# Roles
Board Manager roles are collections of rights that provide access to different features and functionality within Board Manager. System roles are provided with preset rights that are required for users to perform common job roles.  User created roles can also be added.

## Before you begin
* Have an understanding of how [roles are managed](/esp-config/organizational-data/roles).

## System roles
System roles are provided when Board Manager is installed or updated. You can assign users to these roles, but the roles cannot be modified.
