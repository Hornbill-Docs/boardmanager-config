## Roles

Hornbill Roles are used to group users with similar access requirements to the different Hornbill applications. Using roles takes away the need to manage rights on an user by user basis. The following roles are provided by Board Manager to use and allocate to users of the Board Manager application. Custom roles can also be created to meet any specific need.

|Role|Description|
|-|-|
|Boards User|Required for all users of Board Manager. All users assigned this role will see the Board Manager application in the Hornbill Menu and have access to create boards, view, move on, and add to boards.|
|Board BPM User|Allows a user account to interact with the Boards Manager app via business process automation (add, move, remove cards from boards automatically etc), the user will not have access directly to boards with this role.|
|Board Super User|Provides the user with access to all boards, and the ability via the Share Boards options to change the owner of any board.|
