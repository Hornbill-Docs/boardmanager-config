# Settings
A number of advanced settings have been provided to allow for default configurations on how the Board Management app works.

* **app.view.board.largeboard**<br>This setting limits the number of cards that are available to a single board. The default is set to 200 cards. The number of cards on a board will affect performance and it is not recommended to go above the default value of 200.
* **webapp.view.boardlist.favouriteFilter**<br>Turn this setting on to allow users to define and view a Favorites list when viewing the list of available boards.
